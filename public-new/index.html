    <h1>What to expect from Roodwitblauw (RWB)?</h1>
    
    <div class="box">
      <h2>The intake / interview</h2>
      <p>Several questions will be answered during the 30 minute intake.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>What is your goal?</dt>
        <dd>
          Different students have different goals.
          You tell me what problems you encounter in your use of the Dutch language.
          A custom made course will be developed for you.
          Changing your goal or focus after some lessons is no problem.
        </dd>
        <dt>What is your actual level?</dt>
        <dd>
          Our conversation at the intake gives me an impression of your level.
          Should you want to know exactly what your level is, tests can be taken for listening,
          writing and reading. A separate appointment will be made for these tests.
        </dd>
        <dt>The course: how long, how often, where and when? </dt>
        <dd>
          The possibilities are endless.
          From once every two weeks to three times a week,
          according to your wishes and our agendas.
          Private lessons are usually given at my house,
          but I can come to your house or office if necessary.

      <h2>The lessons</h2>
      <p>
        Lessons start with a conversation.
        When you make mistakes,
        I explain what you do wrong and what you can do to avoid those mistakes.
        If you wish, you get homework.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also bring in difficulties you encounter e.g. writing an e-mail or reading official documents.
        I try to help you immediately or look things up and discuss them in the next lesson.
        Asking questions is encouraged! You can also contact me via e-mail in between lessons.

    <div class="box">
      <h2>Teaching materials</h2>
      <p>

        newspaper articles, DVDs, recordings of texts and conversations and copies
        of Staatsexamen NT2 I and II(official Dutch as a second language exams).
        If needed, additional books or other materials are purchased.
        I make sure the materials suit your needs. I am constantly in touch with publishers and fellow trainers,
        so any question I cannot answer immediately, will be answered as soon as possible.

        My name is Machteld Voerman. I have been teaching 'Dutch as a second language' since 2001,
        first as a volunteer at the refugee centre in Wageningen, after that at ROC A12 (secondary education) and freelance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know from experience what moving to a foreign country and learning its language means.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating from the Agricultural University in Wageningen in 1985,
        I lived and worked in Bénin (West Africa), Indonesia and the USA.
        The more you understand a language, the better you understand the people and their culture.
        But I also experienced that it is possible to spend several years in a country without further improving your language skills.
        Learning a language takes time and effort as well as people who are willing to correct your mistakes in a friendly, effective way.
        If I asked people to correct my errors, they often answered: "We understand what you mean".
        But then you keep making the same mistakes over and over again and that bothered me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in the Netherlands in 2001 I decided to become a trainer in 'Dutch as a second language'.
        After graduating I worked for ROC A12 with a wide range of students:
        from illiterates to university students from over 32 countries, individually and in groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2010 I founded my own company: Roodwitblauw.
        I expected to be able to help many people from Wageningen and surroundings to improve their Dutch in an effective and relaxed way.
        Now I can say that more than 60 people from 30 different countries have found their way to Roodwitblauw
        and are experiencing what the improvement of their Dutch means in their day to day lives at work and socially.
