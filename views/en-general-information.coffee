            Different students have different goals. You tell me what problems
            you encounter in your use of the Dutch language.
            A custom made course will be developed for you.
            Changing your goal or focus after some lessons is no problem.

        text '''
            Our conversation at the intake gives me an impression of your level.
            Should you want to know exactly what your level is, tests can be taken
            for listening, writing and reading. A separate appointment will be
            made for these tests.

            The possibilities are endless. From once every two weeks to three
            times a week, according to your wishes and our agendas. Private
            lessons are usually given at my house, but I can come to your house
            or office if necessary.

h2 "The lessons"

p '''
    Lessons start with a conversation.
    When you make mistakes, I explain what you do wrong and what you can
    do to avoid those mistakes. If you wish, you get homework. 
'''

p '''
    You can also bring in difficulties you encounter e.g. writing an e-mail
    or reading official documents. I try to help you immediately or look
    things up and discuss them in the next lesson.
    Asking questions is encouraged!
    You can also contact me via e-mail in between lessons.

h2 "Teaching materials"

p '''
    A lot of teaching materials are available at RWB: textbooks, grammars,
    workbooks, newspaper articles, DVDs, recordings of texts and conversations
    and copies of Staatsexamen NT2 I and II(official Dutch as a second
    language exams). If needed, additional books or other materials are purchased.
    I make sure the materials suit your needs. I am constantly in touch with
    publishers and fellow trainers, so any question I cannot answer immediately,
    will be answered as soon as possible.
